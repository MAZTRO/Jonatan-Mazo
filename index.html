          <p class="description">
            I'm a person who likes software development and some of 2D and 3D design, and being able to combine these two passions gives me great joy and motivates me to continue learning from both disciplines.<br><br>
            This has led me to learn about the development of video games, VR / AR applications and web applications with a design at the height of today's great platforms.<br><br>
            Not only do I like the design and the code, I also like sports such as BMX, soccer and high speeds, either on a motorcycle or in a car. In the future I would like to try Snowboarding.<br><br>
            I'm a big fan of the Nordic countries, their history, their customs, their mythology and of course their culture, I would like to travel someone day and if possible live in one of its countries.<br><br>

            Please feel free to contact me. Would be lovely to hear from you.
